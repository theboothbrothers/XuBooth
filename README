Getting a working copy
--------------------------------------------

 - a subfolder XuBooth will be created and a working copy of the current version will be downloaded to this folder
 - the user gitro is a read-only user so you won't be able to upload changes to the git server


Updating the working copy
--------------------------------------------
 - run "update.sh" to remove any changes and load the latest stable version from the internet


Uploading changes to the git server

 - first you need to stage and commit all changes with a comment
